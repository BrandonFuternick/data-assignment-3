    <p>The New York State Department of Labor (NYSDOL) recently released unemployment data for the month of October 2020. Largely due to business closures in the coronavirus pandemic, unemployment rates across the state show a stark increase from the
      same time period
      last year. New York State’s overall unemployment rate for this time period is 9.2%, more than doubling the rate of 3.7% from October 2019. Though no county in the state was immune from unemployment increases, the largest increase was seen in
      the Bronx, whose unemployment rate for October 2020 was 17.5%, an increase of 12.5 percentage points from October 2019’s 5.0%.<br><br>

      According to a fact sheet shared by the NYSDOL press office, unemployment numbers specifically include “all persons who had no employment during the reference week, were available for work, except for temporary illness, and had made specific
      efforts to find employment sometime during the 4-week period ending with the reference week.”</p>
